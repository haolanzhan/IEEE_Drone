# IEEE_Drone
Project for Northwestern IEEE, 2021 Winter.

Includes python code, to be run remotely on a Raspberry Pi Zero via a wireless SSH connection.

Python code activates the camera module, takes a picture, calls an object recognition API from nanonets, and Prints to the terminal whether the 
picture is of a person wearing a mask or not, and a confidence probability.
